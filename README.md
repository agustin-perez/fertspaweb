This is a repo for my ESI graduation project "Sistema de Logística y Trazabilidad Automotriz", also known as "Logitask".
Fertspa studios is a fictional company that produces software for logistics companies.
ESI stands for "Escuela Superior de Informática", that is an IT high school here in Uruguay.
Logitask can be found in my repo "logitask".
